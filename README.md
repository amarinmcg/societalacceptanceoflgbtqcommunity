### Research Question
How do demographic factors (age, education, religion, and political views) correlate with attitudes, understanding, and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community?

### Research Goals

This project aims to identify key demographic and experiential factors that correlate with LGBTQ+ acceptance and understanding. The findings can inform public education initiatives, policy development, and community outreach programs.

### Hypothesis

Higher levels of education, younger age groups, and increased frequency of interaction with LGBTQ+ individuals will positively correlate with greater acceptance and understanding of LGBTQ+ issues.
